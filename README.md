# Fusllstack Technical Test

This is the Technical Test for Fullstack Developer.
This project consists of Weighted Strings, Balanced Bracket, and Highest Palindrome.

Stack:
1. Dot Net Core 8.0
2. Angular 18

Balanced Bracket Complexity Analysis
Time Complexity: O(n)
The function iterates through each character in the string exactly once, performing constant time operations for each character (either pushing/popping from the stack or checking matches). Hence, the time complexity is O(n), where n is the length of the input string.

Space Complexity: O(n)
In the worst case, all opening brackets are pushed onto the stack without any closing brackets, resulting in the stack holding all n characters. Therefore, the space complexity is O(n).

This ensures the solution is efficient both in terms of time and space, handling the problem with the lowest complexity possible.
